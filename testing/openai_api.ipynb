    "- Topical Treatments: Products like Aspercreme with 4% lidocaine and CBD ointments are frequently recommended for numbing facial pain.\n",
    "- Physical Remedies: Ice packs, heating pads, cold showers, and migraine caps are widely used for physical relief. Compression (tight headbands or scarves) and darkness are also key.\n",
