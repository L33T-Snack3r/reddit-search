    "<<<<SUMMARY>>>>\n",
    "1. Central Suggestions\n",
    "The central strategies revolve around combinations of over-the-counter (OTC) medications, prescription drugs, and physical remedies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Medications: Common drugs include triptans (e.g., Sumatriptan), NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen, Naproxen), and acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol). Other popular medications are Nurtec, Fioricet, and Benadryl for sedation or nausea relief.\n",
    "- Topical Treatments: Products like Aspercreme with 4% lidocaine and CBD ointments are frequently recommended for numbing facial pain.\n",
    "- Physical Remedies: Ice packs, heating pads, cold showers, and migraine caps are widely used for physical relief. Compression (tight headbands or scarves) and darkness are also key.\n",
    "- Dietary and Hydration Support: Electrolytes, water, and caffeine (in moderation) are emphasized as essential aids.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consensus\n",
    "The community consensus is largely positive about these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aspercreme is hailed as a \"game-changer,\" with numerous users praising its immediate effectiveness and ease of application.\n",
    "- Triptans and combination therapies (e.g., pairing NSAIDs with caffeine) receive widespread support for their efficacy.\n",
    "- OTC remedies like Excedrin and strategies like using cold compresses or dark rooms are universally well-regarded.\n",
    "- Unique remedies such as green light therapy and meditation also receive cautious optimism, often noted as subjective but potentially helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unique and Emerging Suggestions\n",
    "Several lesser-discussed but intriguing approaches surfaced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shockwave Therapy: A user reported significant relief after this treatment, suggesting its potential for muscle-tension-related migraines.\n",
    "- Green Light Therapy: Some users experimented with green light filters or lamps, noting reduced migraine intensity, although effects were not universally confirmed.\n",
    "- Dietary Additions: Specific items like fresh lemonade or magnesium supplements were mentioned as beneficial, with anecdotal evidence of effectiveness.\n",
    "- Singing Bowls and ASMR: While polarizing, some users found these methods helpful for relaxation during migraines.\n",

Users widely endorse triptans, NSAIDs, and combination therapies like Excedrin and caffeine for their effectiveness, often providing rapid and reliable relief. Prescription options such as Sumatriptan and Nurtec are frequently highlighted as particularly effective.\n",

The last time, we were at a place with a large screen that even made me nauseated. \\n\\nWhat's your go-to migraine relief? Are there any products you’d recommend, especially ones that can fit in a handbag for these unpredictable situations? What products do you use to prevent or manage migraines at home? \\n\\nI'd appreciate your help & Happy New Year. \\n   \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Ice cold coke while taking a hot shower in a dark bathroom.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Omg this sounds delightful even without a migraine\\n      \\n            \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Add two Advil and a Benadryl and it's a party\\n      \\n            \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Oh man that sounds wonderful\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Ubrelvy and wrapping my head tightly\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      How/with what do you wrap your head?\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         A long sleeve shirt. I saw someone on here using a belt and might start doing that\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Starbucks iced brown sugar oat shaken espresso and their beyond meat vegan breakfast roll, plus co-codamol or Almotriptan if it’s too far gone. I’ve started Ajovy and thankfully it’s reduced the frequency of my migraines- they tend to only appear around my period now thankfully.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      That’s wild, I crave those things when I have a migraine, especially that particular drink. That’s hilarious.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         It once saved me from a three day migraine! So yummy as well.\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Salt, ubrelvy, and a metric fuck ton of water\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Ubrevly users unite! Fountain diet coke or diet Dr pepper soda is in my arsenal too, might be placebo\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Nurtec, but my insurance has decided that I can’t have it any more. So, I’ll be starting from scratch again.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      No! I hate that for you! I hope you find something that helps you soon 💕\\n      \\n            \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Contact Pfizer they may can help with this. It’s a few hoops to jump through but I know other ppl have gotten help from the company before. Best of luck\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I always have migraine painkillers in my bag be they over the counter or pharmacy. \\n   Always water with me.\\n   I have abortives which I keep with me from the GP. \\n   \\n   Always have a way home too. I always make sure no matter what, I can get home/wherever I'm staying quickly\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Cambia, eletriptan, zofran, forehead icepack, heat on my neck. Used to use amitryptaline as a daily prophylactic but am now trialing topiramate.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Oh also Mg and CoeQ daily\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Weed and caffeine! I'm also on nurtec which is so helpful.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Nurtec, ice and sleep\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Quick migraine relief that’s helped me is taking excedrine/sumatriptan with a carbonated drink like a cold Coke or sprite. Then get home, immediately lay down and take a nap (only cause sumatriptan makes me sleepy). I place a heating pad on the back of my head/neck. That seems to calm down a sudden migraine attack then when I wake up I will take Nurtec and ibuprofen if I’m not feeling any better. \\n   If you’re out and about, keeping excedrine or non drowsy abortives on hand. Staying as hydrated as you can! Sometimes a sugary coffee like a frappe or soda can help calm down one or giving yourself a brain freeze by eating icecream or a slushy. Idk why a brain freeze temporarily helps, but it’s enough to get you home in an emergency.\\n   Best of luck 💕\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   OTC - ibuprofen taken with Sudafed, or Benadryl if it's close enough to sleep time. Chugging a mini Gatorade & sipping on a second.\\n   \\n   Meds, meds, meds if I know it's going to be a bad one. Currently on Ajvoy preventative & I use both Frovatriptan & Naratriptan, Frova usually more for my menstrual migraines.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I'll usually start with water to make sure I'm not dehydrated, take an otc (I switched naproxen but it doesn't really fo much), caffeine if it's accessible. If my migraine is moving quickly, it's a hot shower with cbd balm rubbed on neck and shoulders. I'll avoid my phone if I can but otherwise everything turned all the way down or off. Sunglasses help. I purchased fl-41 glasses and these are so helpful for when I need to function through an episode.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   First time on this thread, I thought I was crazy thinking mcdonalds helps but I love that multiple people have mentioned it\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      I felt that way too though it has been a migraine treatment for me for about 20 years now 🤣 I don’t do McDonald’s anymore for personal reasons but pretty much fries and a coke help a lot. Even all my loved ones know to get it for me if I’m incapacitated.\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Sugar, caffeine and an abortive. Hypoglycaemia seems to be present in many of my migraine episodes. Caffeine and sugar/salt can help on the first symptoms. As for an abortive, it’s all about trial and error to find the most appropriate one.\\n   I also have a qalm device. It does not prevent my episodes, but sometimes it helps mitigate the pain.\\n   I used to take a CBD isolate as needed but unfortunately it stopped working altogether, but in tea/oil form could be something worth trying. Best luck\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   ibuprofen, then weed, then triptan. constantly sip water, lay down and rest in a dark, quiet room by myself\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Eletriptan & zofran\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Im literally in the middle of this. Stopped for food took sumitriptan, got full sugar dr pepper and sent my hubby across the street to get me naproxen cause I ran out. Also getting me bbq\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I use naratriptan but I have to wait until it kicks off properly or it will come back later. I have a tiny pill keyring on my keys and I keep one in there. I also don't drive further than 20 minutes from home these days in case im unable to drive. naratriptan makes me feel rubbish the next day but ive decided its worth it.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I have recently discovered caffeine/spice/salt combo will sometimes pull me from a migraine for a couple hours but usually I need protein heavy meal then hot pack and sleep with a neck pillow to keep it away. Sadly can't do this every time because it's too expensive. So I'm on several meds that do an okay job.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   McDonald’s (per advice on here) and a sleep mask 😉\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Cefaly!!! It’s expensive but so worth it. I also drink a lot of electrolytes. When I have a migraine I do the regime of sumatriptan, Frovatriptan, Cefaly, migraine ice cap, McDonald’s fries and nuggets and a coke, electrolytes, and a Benadryl. Usually helps a lot. But the Cefaly is by the best and provides me with the most instant relief.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Prevention: Botox, qulitpa, vidabotan migraine relief supplement\\n   Acute: Reyvow\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Ice, zomitriptan OR exedrin and Benadryl\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Excedrin, Peppermint Oil, my Headache Hat, and QUIET DARKNESS\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   OTC:\\n   I used to get some relief from acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but I started a daily NSAID (meloxicam) so I can’t do the ibuprofen anymore. \\n   \\n   Prescription:\\n   I was just prescribed sumatriptan and it’s gotten rid of my migraines both time I took it. It is giving me some weird side effects, though, but I’m going to see about trying a different triptan. \\n   \\n   Either way, I need to get into a quiet place. Whether I have pain or not, because sometimes I have a silent migraine, I cry when there’s too much noise. Not even loud noise, just talking does me in.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Maxalt, two acetaminophen and coke. Sleep with either heat or ice pack on my eyes. If it’s really bad McDonald’s fries.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   2 Excedrin Migraine, 1 sumatriptan, bottle of diet Dr. Pepper, 40oz of ice water for sipping, ice pack hat, additional ice back on neck, lay on back in dark and silent room. Profit.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Biofreeze helps.  Temples, back of neck, traps.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   For the purse:\\n   \\n   Electrolyte packets/salt tablets, the small bottle of Wishgarden Herbs “Cranial Comfort” tincture (I refill it from the large jigger bottles they sell on their website- this tincture has SAVED me over the past year when my migraines have been so bad and my HMO insurance wouldn’t pay for CGRP drugs), and candied ginger in a baggie. \\n   \\n   For home- ice packs, ice caps, with heating pad on the neck, Salonpas patches all over head and neck, or Tigerbalm cream- but WASH HANDS!!!! And baths. Lots of baths.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Oh and sunglasses (inside AND out) and my Loops earplugs.\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   OTC: \\n   -Cefaly (this has helped reduce my migraines by half!!!!)\\n   - Excedrin (be careful bc MOH)\\n   - LMNT electrolyte packets\\n   \\n   Prescribed:\\n   - Nurtec (for acute)\\n   - Qulipta (for preventative)\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   For acute treatment, definitely talk to your dr about a triptan prescription. You don’t want to have too many full migraine sessions if you can help it. Look it up, but it’s something along the lines of, the more you have, the more likely they will become chronic & not occasional. For this reason , it is also worth following a predictable sleeping & eating schedule. \\n   I don’t have a single known trigger—but I do better when I reduce caffeine, sugar & high carbs diet. I try to have protein snacks every 2-3 hours. I do NOT eat low fat anything. (See Dr Elena Gross) Plus drink more water. Avoid bright & flashing lights/loud places. That’s what helps me: everyone is different. But again—triptans have been a life saver for me. I carry one in my purse ALWAYS.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I was pregnant most of 2024 and seems ridiculous that I’d forgotten my go to meds. For now a triptan, anti-emetic and a beta blocker seem to work.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Emgality shots for prevention. Eletriptan for attacks. Cold cap for head, heating pad for back, get to sleep if possible. I carry eletriptan on my key chain. I’ll try benedryll and excedrine if I think I can head it off and avoid using a triptan. LMNT drink power then all the carbs once it breaks.

Because while marijuana can work for them, it can be absolute MURDER for cluster headaches and tension headaches. A _must_ avoid. Both of those issues can share quite a lot of symptoms in common with migraines, and it\\'s not uncommon for one or more of those other disorders to be present in migraine sufferers, which makes therapies a lot more difficult.\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Yes, I got diagnosed at 11 and I’m under the care of neurologist.

It\\'s analgesic effects are only quasi medically valid. What _is_ proving more and more interesting is its theraputic effects on seizures, and migraines share some clinical similarity to that. It\\'s _probably_ regulating your brain chemistry. By all means, keep your doctor in the loop if you have access, but the future looks bright for folks suffering seizures and migraines. Marijuana appears to function as an \"off\" switch for those disorders in many cases.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         I like to say that it allows me to have some space to accept the pain better.

In my miss-spent youth, and idiotic older years I managed to get 30+ concussions.  I know what I did to get here, but not really sure at times how to keep dealing.  I am currently taking Verapamil daily to try and prevent them, but still have 2 or 3 a week. I am an electronic technician and solder using a microscope all day every day.  They also happen on the weekends so it is not completely work related.  I recently convinced my boss to buy a [Mantis](https://www.qsource.com/itemdetail/?itemCode=MCH-001-MCS-005-4X-V016&gclid=CjwKCAiA7IGcBhA8EiwAFfUDsR5SDrooZSoCkl5hYuyVooGuSdb3nnl-73Md4GJcZPDkG8SoJwhNtBoCB_0QAvD_BwE) scope for me to use and it has helped reduce the amount of incidents from 4-5 to 2-3.  If you use a scope for work, look into one!\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I used Maxalt by prescription.   Lots of times I used Execedrin Migraine.  But I stopped getting migraines when I got a daith piercing.  There\\'s no scientific evidence that it works, but tons of anecdotal reports.  I decided to give it a try, figuring I had nothing to lose.  That was in April 2017, and I\\'ve not had a migraine since.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      For others reading this, I think you see a lot of controversy with daith piercings due to migraine triggers. Food triggers probably won\\'t be affected by daith piercings, but environmental might. IMO, If you like the look it doesn\\'t hurt to try it out though!\\n      \\n            \\n      <REPLY>\\n      That’s really interesting to hear, I’ve never heard of that treatment before but I don’t doubt it at all. Scientific evidence and migraines don’t have a great history\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I tried a bunch of different pills an wafer things but i ended up settling on one codeine tablet that also contains some paracetamol, and one ibuprofen tablet, those two tablets aren\\'t really meant to compliment each other because they work differently, but it works great for me 🤷\\u200d♀️\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      You\\'ve got it backwards. BECAUSE they\\'re different classes of analgesic, they DO compliment each other. They allow you to ingest MORE analgesic safely because they\\'re eliminated from the body via very different processes/organs. There are also studies that show while tylenol is a dubious analgesic, it _does_ have a strange property in that it seems to enhance the pain relieving powers of NSAIDs, and prolong the effect more so than just NSAIDs alone.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Well that\\'s good to know!\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I take my sumatriptin when one comes on, I also take a qulipta daily which is a preventive.

Most people have one and diet is always the first place to try.  After that think outside the box.  Mines from my bad heart.  Yeah migraines have a lot of triggers. and you gotta watch the heart.  People with migraines are twice as likely to have heart issues too.  Or perhaps the heart triggers just enough for that statistic?  \\n   \\n   Regardless, find the trigger first.  Use otc pain relievers, marijuana, dark spots , for relief but that trigger is king.  It\\'s the cure versus just a treatment.  \\n   \\n   And caffeine is both awesome and terrible.  Those of us suffering for years can write books about caffeine and marijuana too and how it really works. And how it doesn\\'t.

Once, I had a kind of seizure, and had to take some pills for a few years. I\\'ve never had an aura again.\\n   \\n   However, I keep getting migraines.

Scared the shit out of me too. And then after the pain stopped, I was almost in a stupor for an hour or two. Exhausted and mentally foggy. Shit was obscene.\\n      \\n            \\n      <REPLY>\\n      I get auras... they scare the crap out if me. I\\'ve learned to take painkillers and get into bed as soon as the aura starts and it reduced the the duration. I had one migraine that had several auras a day for 5 days. I had to got to A+E for IV pain meds and rehydration 3 timed over that 5 days. I bloody hate migraines.\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   A pain killer cocktail.  Half-doses of Naproxen Sodium and Ibuprofen washed down with caffeine (usually soda)\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Did your doc tell you to do this? Because this is not a good thing to do. Naproxen and Ibuprofen are both NSAIDs, and are NOT supposed to be taken together. You would be better served taking prescription strength doses of Ibuprofen alone if you feel you need a lot of medicine. Though Naproxin _does_ target facial and cranial nerves a little more effectively, which is why it\\'s the drug most dentists recommend post procedure, it also has a much less forgiving \"grey area\" than ibuprofen. I will not recommend you toy around with ANY drug outside of normal dosage specifications, but ibuprofen _can_ __USUALLY__ be taken in much higher doses safely than even tylenol. Both Naproxen and tylenol\\'s maximum dosage is at the bleeding edge of safety, where as ibuprofen can be taken up to 800mg at a time, twice a day.\\n      \\n      If your doc told you to do what you\\'re doing, listen to them. But if you\\'re just playing chemist, you\\'re playing with fire mixing those two meds.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         It is just what works. I do only use half-doses, though. One pill of each, instead of two. I don\\'t know why it works, but it does for me.\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Imitrex\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Once the migraine starts, I haven\\'t found anything that helps. But I can sometimes stop one before it develops if I take ibuprofen early enough, as soon I have the slightest hint of the initial symptoms (headache is the obvious one, but often I actually find loss of appetite, followed by nausea, comes first).\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I have a tried so many things and they all stopped working so I’m now at the point of Botox. Just got my first round and there won’t be a noticeable difference for a bit so fingers crossed. In the meantime, I pay attention to the first sign and take Advil migraine and sometimes I’ll add in some CBD oil for anxiety while waiting for the meds to work. If it gets bad I go to the hospital for some IV fluids and torridol. Hang in there!\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Ah sorry to hear that! I’ve been pitched Botox before but never have, I really hope it works for you!\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Thanks, I hope so, too! I was really nervous but I will say the doctor was really good.

Ibuprofen and a small amount of caffeine helped acutely, but not absolutely nor with equal efficacy each time. \\n   \\n   Then, just as mysteriously as they started, they\\'ve gone away. And I wish that for every single one of you. I\\'ve been in the ER, vomiting in pain and begging for death, if not medication, to stop the insidious attempts of my brain to eat its way out of my skull. There\\'s no negotiation with that level of suffering, no machismo that can tough it through.

Using the aspercreme will numb the nerves on my face and temple long enough for the \"cocktail\" to kick in. \\n   \\n   Works ever single time.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Immediately bought some Aspercreme. Exciting to give it a try.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         It\\'s going to change your life. I promise. I literally keep a bottle in my car just on case I get a migraine in public.\\n         \\n                  \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Mine is on the away. \\n         Is it scented, they asked nervously,?\\n         NM saw the other response below. \\n         Now anxiously awaiting aspercreme\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            I got the roll on and it said non scented.\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               Thx!\\n               \\n                     \\n      <REPLY>\\n      I may have to try the aspercreme. I frequently get facial pain with my migraines. Is the smell strong?\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         No, it\\'s unscented lol. It\\'s nothing like icyhot. I buy this stuff in the giant bottles because it\\'s always go to.\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Oh dang I love the minty smells 🤣 I dab peppermint oil on my shirt just to smell it, I feel like it helps me with anxiety too lol\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               Salonpas provide that comforting minty goodness! They also do a great job disrupting the neck pain signals.\\n               \\n                           \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Okay, thank you! I’m definitely going to give it a try.\\n            \\n                  \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Interesting!! Does it not sting your eyes/ skin?\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Oops, maybe I meant eyebrows haha. I rub it wherever the trigeminal nerve path is on the face and temples. It\\'s the greatest thing I ever learned for migraine control.\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Oh no I get it just being that close to eyes doesn’t sting? I’m totally going to try this!!!!\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               No it won\\'t sting. Everyone please try this. It\\'s a total game changer.\\n               \\n                        \\n         <REPLY>\\n         I use icy hot or menthol/mint cbd balm. Definitely accidentally gotten it in my eyes before and it does sting a bit and makes my eyes water but I think that also distracts from the head pain for a second 🤣\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Give aspercreme a try, it\\'s more for numbing nerves, whereas Icyhot is specifically for muscles and joints. Aspercreme won\\'t burn and it\\'s fragrance free. You\\'ll feel the numbing almost immediately.\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               I have it saved in my list on Amazon for when I get paid this week!!\\n               \\n                                 \\n                  <REPLY>\\n                  🙌 get that money lol.\\n                  \\n                                       \\n                     <REPLY>\\n                     Working on it, literally 🤣\\n                     \\n                                 \\n            <REPLY>\\n            I’ve gotten the CBD and tiger balm ointments near my eyes one too many times and it sucks lol\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               Yeah it\\'s not pleasant for sure lol\\n               \\n                     \\n      <REPLY>\\n      I always see Aspercreme, I think I might try it after seeing this! That sounds helpful\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Yeah make sure it says with lidocaine 4%. This hack was an absolute game changer for me, because I could just apply it while I was at work, or school and it would provide temporary relief for like a good hour until I could get actual meds.\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Do you get the lotion or roll-on version?\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               It\\'s the lotion bottle, here\\'s a link to Target so you can see: [Aspercreme with 4% Lidocaine](https://www.target.com/p/aspercreme-lidocaine-pain-relieving-creme-2-7oz/-/A-16836627)\\n               \\n                              \\n               <REPLY>\\n               following bc I’m curious too\\n               \\n                                 \\n                  <REPLY>\\n                  Here\\'s the exact bottle I\\'m talking about: [Aspercreme with 4% Lidocaine](https://www.target.com/p/aspercreme-lidocaine-pain-relieving-creme-2-7oz/-/A-16836627)\\n                  \\n                              \\n            <REPLY>\\n            never heard of it in the UK, wonder if it has another name\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               Was thinking the same…Can’t find it on amazon!\\n               \\n                                 \\n                  <REPLY>\\n                  [deleted]\\n                  \\n                                       \\n                     <REPLY>\\n                     Thank you!!\\n                     \\n                                 \\n            <REPLY>\\n            At this point, Aspercreme should give you a deal for all the publicity you’ve given it on this thread!

I find that throwing up helps sometimes .. I used to take nurtec but it only worked 50% of the time\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Nausea is one of my primary symptoms too, and I just wanted to share that getting a prescription for odansentron (Zofran) has been a real game-changer. Breaking the nausea/vomiting seems to let the other treatments work more effectively. Might be worth trying if you haven\\'t already.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         I used to Zofran as well and often found it seemed like I got more relief from that than from triptans. I thought it was just a fluke but I saw a comment from an RN on this sub months ago about how it has actually been shown to aid with migraine relief itself!\\n         \\n                  \\n         <REPLY>\\n         I buy the Walmart brand motion sickness pills.

Maybe I\\'ll look into it.\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               This one actually says non-drowsy on the label. I usually end up falling asleep but not from that pill.\\n               \\n                     \\n      <REPLY>\\n      A hot bath sounds great for migraines, I love that. Sorry you have to deal with nausea :( nausea is such an awful feeling\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Med cocktail (naratriptan, compazine and toradol or a Nurtec), dark room, ice pack for my head, heating pad for my neck, meditation music turned low, ceiling fan, blanket, one pillow, migraine roll on, white flower oil massaged on my neck, massage if I can tolerate the touch, cold water to sip to help with the nausea.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      These things plus cefaly\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Sounds awful but I swear by it: shock your nervous system with freezing / steaming water. \\n   \\n   Get in your shower I usually just sit in the bottom lol (easiest to start on warm) turn the water as hot as you can possibly handle on your back for 30-60seconds.\\n   \\n   Then turn it as cold as it will go. And stay under as long as you can handle. Go back and forth & repeat.\\n   \\n   Do this WITH medication (I usually take amitriptyline & 1000 of Tylenol) but this can help take you out of the 911 headache state while you wait for meds to kick in.\\n   \\n   This is also in my experience the best way to prevent a migraine puke if you feel it coming on, and to prevent you from puking meds back up if you struggle with that when your migraine is 11/10 bad.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      I love this, thank you for sharing! Sounds a little scary lol but I’ll try it next time. \\n      \\n      We’ve had some folk remedy suggestions but have yet to try some of them. Mostly has to do with water so maybe it has a similar effect of doing something to the nervous system\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I have pre-made “migraine packs” of medications that I stash in my purse, backpack, etc. to take when I have a migraine. They contain:\\n   - 4 Advil\\n   - 2 Tylenol \\n   - 100 mg ubrelvy\\n   - cbd capsule (from the only brand that works for me)\\n   - a Benadryl (to make me sleep)\\n   \\n   Additionally I have a rice sock I keep in the freezer to put on my head/ face, and a little dinosaur lamp that glows green (the least irritating color of light for migraines). \\n   \\n   I generally just take a migraine pack, close all my shades, turn on the dinosaur lamp, and prop myself in a corner with pillows and the rice sock until the pain subsides enough that I can lay down and sleep through the rest of it.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      What brand of the CBD do you recommend?\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Tim’s Naturals CBD capsules\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Nurtec, microwavable heating pad on my neck/forehead, exist in the dark, ginger hard candies for nausea, electrolytes.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      A heating pad on the neck sounds so nice.

I have an unopened box and I feel like it would definitely help me but thinking about how it tastes makes me feel nauseous on top of my already shitty migraine symptoms.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         I have only ever taken it straight. Agreed on the atrocious flavor. This sounds weird but works for me: I have found trying to place it towards the tip of the tongue quickly followed by either a fast chaser of orange juice or water and a cracker/tortilla chip ( I will take a cracker and scrape away any leftover powder and then eat it just to neutralize any lingering taste).\\n         \\n         Disclaimer my first symptom is usually visual aura so I\\'m taking these quickly before my nausea has fully kicked in. Also think my body knows BC powder is our only hope so it lets me keep it down lol. Hope this helps :)\\n         \\n                  \\n         <REPLY>\\n         They now make BC powder that has a cherry flavor and it was actually pretty, dare I say, good. I took it just last week. BUT, my go to for OG BC was to dump it in a shots worth of a bubbly beverage - diet Coke, etc. The bubbles covered the flavor. Godspeed.\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   2+ Fioricet\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Mix and match depending on where the pain/how bad symptoms are etc but mine:\\n   - 100mg ubrelvy, 500mg naproxen, 800mg ibuprofen + benadryl or flexaril (muscle relaxer), zofran for nausea\\n   - electrolytes, extra magnesium, extra ginger\\n   - coffee \\n   - ice hats\\n   - heat on neck/shoulder if neck pain or if my occipital nerve is involved (I have a heating pad and a heating up shoulder thing that\\'s microwavable). Laying on a floor, foam roller on the next and moving my head side to side helps relieve some of the occipital nerve being angry during some of my migraines.\\n   - cefaly device\\n   - relivion device\\n   - guasha massaging wherever the tension is (f.e. my jaw and right side of the neck gets bad (TMJD). Trying to use the tool can hurt but in a relieving kind of way)\\n   - salonpas patches or lidocaine patches/roll on on the neck/temples\\n   - cbd/thc creme\\n   - allay green light lamp\\n   - loop earplugs if noise sensitive\\n   - avulux glasses and all the lights are either off, or dimmed on green or im using the allay lamp to navigate space (it\\'s dimmable). If im able to - sometimes having an ice hat and taking a hot bath can feel nice. The allay lamps color is soothing as well to just exist in that bathtub w/Epsom salt. But depends, I\\'m way too sensory overloaded most of the time for that\\n   - Peppermint roll on\\n   - McDonalds fries and nuggets +coke lol \\n   - I have steroids at home I could use if it\\'s not breaking or I just go to Urgent Care if it hasnt broken for more thn 3 days +I\\'ve been throwing up. IV with fluids plus meds usually helps to break it.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Since you already like the gua sha, I highly recommend the shampoo massager! It feels amazing on your head.\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         The electric one or regular/plasticy one? I have the plastic one but my hair is curly, it\\'s easier to just use the guasha tool to avoid tangles for me unless I\\'m actually washing my hair, thn it feels great 😅 and I do get allodynia sometimes and the scalp is the last thing I want to touch but I can do my neck with the gua sha tool f.e.\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Oh man, there\\'s an electric one?! I need to check it out. Ive only just tried the plastic one. When i was standing in the bath aisle at Home Sense my head got tingly just thinking about it lol so bought it for that reason alone haha \\n            I also need to learn all these gua sha techniques for pain - you\\'re making me very excited to try it!\\n            \\n                           \\n               <REPLY>\\n               Look up electric scalp massager on amazon, it should come up.

I’ve been reassured by my neuro and my pharmacist that serotonin syndrome is extremely rare and that using multiple serotonin influencing medications can be quite safe. I’m taking psych meds (fluoxetine and buspirone) as well as migraine preventatives (amitriptyline) and abortives (zolmotriptan/sumatriptan) that all have the scary potential serotonin syndrome warning. I added the new ones very slowly and knew what to look out for symptom wise. This, along with supplements and cefaly, has brought my migraine frequency down from 20 brutal attacks per month to about 5 treatable attacks per month.\\n         \\n                     \\n            <REPLY>\\n            Thank you, that was years ago, so I do think I should maybe revisit the possibility of preventative or abortive medicine.

I’m not sure why those help better than anything else but they do.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   I\\'m currently not on any migraine medication due to insurance issues, but I am hoping to be back on it soon. \\n   \\n   My unmedicated migraine routine goes as so:\\n   \\n   * Take 2 ibuprofen, 2 acetaminophen, and 1 caffiene pill.\\n   * If I\\'m not feeling nauseous, try to down a small snack like a peanut butter sandwich or a poptart. It helps the medicine to not anger my gut.\\n   * Make sure I have water in my water bottle.\\n   * Change into my sleeping clothes.\\n   * Make sure the vent is closed so it doesn\\'t blow hot or cold air on my face.\\n   * Silence and dim my phone.\\n   * Turn the ceiling fan on low so when I randomly feel hot from the migraine I can kick off the covers and cool off quickly.\\n   * Make sure I have my head scarf I use to cover my eyes. \\n   * If my light sensitivity is bad enough, unplug the night lights.\\n   * Put my glasses in their case so they don\\'t get scratched if I hit them and they fall\\n   * Close the blinds and curtains if they are open\\n   * Turn off the light, cover up my body, cover my eyes with the scarf, and cover my head with my head blanket. \\n   * Finally set in for the migraine and hope it is one of those where my body gives up on dealing with the pain so it makes me sleep so I don\\'t have to consciously suffer through it. \\n   \\n   Medicated is only different in that I don\\'t take any OTC medications.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      The last bullet point is so valid. All you can hope for is to sleep through it so you don’t suffer while awake. \\n      \\n      Before my mom got on Botox, we had to take her to the ER constantly due to how awful her migraines were. They’d try morphine and it wouldn’t really work. Since then she’s tried many, and Botox seems to help, but sometimes it doesn’t. Since it’s hereditary and mostly women get it…we are hoping my niece doesn’t develop migraines in her teens.\\n      \\n         \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Throwing up. :/\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      Ugh, that’s awful. I’m so sorry you have to deal with that :(\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         If it gets rid of my headache, then I’ll do anything honestly. I do take medicine as a preventative and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.\\n         \\n            \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   BC powder???\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      What is this?\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         Yes that’s what I’m asking.

Then lay down in a dark place, lay on the side of my head with the pain.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Cocodemol (paracetemol with codeine) as early as possible and if that doesn’t work then add in ibuprofen. Dark room, eye mask and sleep usually works.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   For a headache where I can’t even lift my head off the pillow or take a sip of water without throwing up, I can’t do anything but lay there in misery. \\n   \\n   For a “normal” migraine: I usually eat something bland if I can tolerate it (a banana is my preference) because nsaids give me gastritis. Then I take 2 Advil, omeprazole (to help prevent tummy pain from Advil) and 100 mg of sumatriptan. Then I take a hot shower. If it’s a weekend, I crawl into bed in a dark room and sleep with no alarm until o wake up hopefully feeling better. Depending on how severe the pain still is at this point, I will either tie a scarf around my head real tight or use my ice cap. \\n   \\n   If it’s a weekday, after the meds and shower, I just continue with my day and hope I feel better soon.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Try drinking some coffee and take a couple Aleve or a few ibuprofen. If that doesn’t work I’ll take 1-2mg  of klonopin depending on the severity. Works like a charm. \\n   \\n   I’ve pretty much given up on traditional migraine medicine as it either makes me nauseous or I go through it within a few days. Just feels like a waste of money.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Diclofenic gel topical and migraine cool patches\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n    dark room, often with green light, meditation to distract and relax. Coke. Ice pack or cold glass against my eyes. Wrapped in a blanket so my feet are nice and cozy and my head is cold. In summer I have a fan going while wrapped in a blanket so my head stays old. \\n   Pressure ear plugs if needed. Foot massage if i can sit up for my foot massager or someone is home with me. \\n   Once I feel like I can eat, my \\'dirty migraine foods\\' aka chef boyardee, chips, jerky or any meat. and lipton chicken noodle soup. \\n   \\n   If it\\'s lingering, but not as intense, I go for a really hot shower and it feels great on my neck, face, and head. My massage therapist suggested bringing in a hand towel to place around shoulders and neck to hit the muscles better. Haven\\'t tried it yet, though! Always forget/have to bend for a hand towel and I refuse during an attack.\\n   \\n   I\\'ll also try my mushroom hot chocolate if it\\'s a light one. \\n   \\n   I haven\\'t had much luck with pain meds often, or I wake up with one and it\\'s too late, so i don\\'t use them a lot of the time. I had tramadol for travel if I feel one on a flight or something and just knock myself out. \\n   Usually, I\\'ll take a robaxacet.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Zolmitriptan, normal pain killers don’t even touch it.\\n      \\n   <COMMENT>\\n   Fioricet, fresh lemonade, a joint, then a nap for an hour or so works wonders for me.\\n         \\n      <REPLY>\\n      I’m curious about the fresh lemonade…how does it help\\n      \\n               \\n         <REPLY>\\n         I wish I knew.
