      "      Hi, I had an intractable around 7 years ago. I was miserable and took 6 months off work to get to the bottom of it. One neuro ordered a sleep study and it Turns out I am a shallow breather and my oxygen got really low. I was put on a CPAP and after a month or so they were not daily. I did go on Emgality and i still get them once or twice a month. I use 100mg shot of imitrex with 400 mg of ibuprofen and alternate heat and cold. The migraine cap has been wonderful because it has slight pressure. I wish everyone here a low migraine month. Take care.\n",
